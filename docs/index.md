# Idrak API Documentation

Welcome to the Idrak API documentation. This guide provides an overview of Idrak's Python frontend, designed for hackability, speed, and intuitive deep learning experimentation.

Idrak treats neural networks as pure pipelines of data transformations, giving you unparalleled control and insight into your models.

## Core Modules

*   [Tensor](/docs/tensor.md): The fundamental data structure for all computations.
*   [Pipeline](/docs/pipeline.md): Compose and manage your neural network layers.
*   [Functions](/docs/functions.md): High-level functional operations for building computational graphs.
*   [Experiment](/docs/experiment.md): Track and manage your experimental runs.

## Getting Started

Refer to the main [README.md](../README.md) for installation instructions and a quick start guide.
